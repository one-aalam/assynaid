# Assynaid: Group Management

This guide explains how to use Assynaid's group management features to organize assignees effectively.

## Creating Groups

1. Click the "Group" view button in the main toolbar
2. Click the "New Group" button
3. In the modal that appears:
   - Enter a name for the group
   - Optionally add a description
   - Choose a color (or use the randomly generated one)
   - Select assignees to include in the group
4. Click "Create Group"

The new group will be created and immediately selected in the group view.

## Filtering by Group

Once you have created groups, you can filter assignees by group in two ways:

1. **Using the dropdown selector**: Select a group from the dropdown menu at the top of the group view
2. **Using the group badges**: Click on a group badge in the badges bar to filter by that group

## Removing Groups

To delete an entire group:

1. Navigate to the group view
2. Find the group you want to delete in the badges bar
3. Click the trash icon next to the group badge
4. Confirm deletion in the confirmation dialog

Note: Deleting a group only removes the group itself, not the assignees within it.

## Managing Group Members

### Removing Assignees from Groups

To remove an assignee from a group:

1. Locate the assignee card that shows the group badge you want to remove
2. Hover over the group badge to reveal the remove (X) button
3. Click the X button to remove the assignee from that group

This can be done from either the list view or the group view.

### Adding Assignees to Groups

To add assignees to an existing group:

1. Select the assignees you want to add by clicking on their cards
2. Click "New Group" to open the group creation modal
3. From the dropdown, select the existing group
4. Confirm by clicking "Add to Group"

Alternatively, you can create a new group with the selected assignees using the normal group creation process.

## Group Information

Each group contains:

- **Name**: Used to identify the group
- **Description**: Optional text describing the group's purpose
- **Color**: Visual identifier for the group badges
- **Member Count**: The number of assignees in the group

## Tips for Effective Group Management

1. **Create logical groupings**: Organize assignees by team, department, project role, or any other relevant attribute.

2. **Use descriptive names and colors**: Choose names and colors that make groups immediately recognizable.

3. **Combine groups with search**: You can search within a group to find specific assignees.

4. **Use groups for quick selection**: Select all members of a group at once by toggling group selection.

5. **Clean up regularly**: Remove groups that are no longer needed to keep your interface clean.

## Common Use Cases

- **Team Organization**: Create groups for different teams or departments
- **Project Roles**: Group assignees by their roles in the project (developers, testers, managers)
- **Priority Assignments**: Create groups for high-priority tasks or critical path work
- **On-call Rotation**: Maintain groups for different on-call rotations
- **Regional Teams**: Organize assignees by geographic location

## Troubleshooting Group Issues

**Issue**: Can't remove assignee from group

- Make sure you hover directly over the group badge to reveal the remove button

**Issue**: Group not showing in dropdown

- Try refreshing the extension by clicking "Scan Now"

**Issue**: Group has incorrect members

- Review the group members and remove/add as needed
- Consider recreating the group if many changes are needed

**Issue**: Group color not displaying correctly

- Try choosing a different color or recreating the group

Remember that all group data is stored locally in your browser. If you clear your browser data or use a different browser, you'll need to recreate your groups.
